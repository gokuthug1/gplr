## Changelog

### v2.3.0

-   **Feature: Ambient Mode (Ambilight):** A new setting creates a soft, blurred glow around the player that dynamically matches the colors of the video content, creating a more immersive viewing experience. This can be toggled in the settings menu and is saved between sessions.
-   **Feature: Casting Support:** The player now automatically detects and displays buttons for **AirPlay** (on Safari/iOS) and **Chromecast** (if the Google Cast SDK is present), allowing users to stream content to compatible devices.
-   **Feature: Share Functionality:** A new share button has been added to the controls. Clicking it opens a menu to copy the video URL or copy a link to the video at the current timestamp.
-   **Improvement: High-Performance VTT Thumbnails:** Thumbnail previews on the progress bar are now powered by VTT files (`<track kind="metadata">`). This is significantly more performant than the previous method, resulting in instant, smooth thumbnail previews without seeking a hidden video element.
-   **Refinement: Cleaner UI Feedback:** The central indicator animation for play and pause actions has been removed to reduce visual noise. The indicator still provides essential feedback for seeking and volume changes.

### v2.2.0

-   **Feature: Full Mobile & Touch Support:** The player is now fully responsive and optimized for touch devices.
    -   **Tap to Play/Pause:** A single tap on the video area toggles playback.
    -   **Tap to Show/Hide Controls:** Tapping the video reveals the controls, which auto-hide after a few seconds.
    -   **Draggable Sliders:** The progress and volume sliders are now fully functional with touch-and-drag gestures.
-   **Feature: Double-Tap Gestures:** Inspired by modern mobile video players:
    -   **Double-tap the left or right side** of the video to seek backward or forward by 10 seconds.
    -   **Double-tap the center** of the video to quickly toggle fullscreen mode.
-   **Improvement: Polished Mobile UI:** The user interface has been refined for touch interaction. The volume slider is always visible on mobile (when controls are shown), and the progress bar is thicker for easier scrubbing.
-   **Fix: Updated Quick Start Example:** The HTML example now uses working, direct video links from the Internet Archive.

### v2.1.0

-   **Feature: Expanded Playback Speeds:** Increased the maximum playback speed up to **8x**.
-   **Feature: Volume Memory:** The player now saves your volume and mute settings, restoring them automatically in your next session.
-   **Feature: Central Action Indicator:** A new, non-intrusive icon appears in the center of the player to provide clear visual feedback for actions like play, pause, seek, and volume changes.
-   **Feature: New Keyboard Shortcuts:** Use the **Up/Down Arrow** keys to adjust the volume.
-   **Feature: Double-Click Fullscreen:** You can now double-click the video area to quickly toggle fullscreen mode.

## Theming with CSS Variables

You can easily set a default theme for the player by overriding CSS Custom Properties in your own stylesheet. While users can change these in the settings menu, this defines your site's base look.

```css
/* Example: A red and dark theme with sharp corners */
:root {
  --primary-color: #e74c3c;
  --controls-bg: rgba(15, 15, 15, 0.9);
  --border-radius: 4px;
}
```

### Available Variables

-   `--primary-color`
-   `--text-color`
-   `--controls-bg`
-   `--menu-bg`
-   `--progress-bar-bg`
-   `--border-radius`
-   `--caption-font-family`
-   `--caption-font-size`
-   `--caption-font-color`
-   `--caption-bg-color`
